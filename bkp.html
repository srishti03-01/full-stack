        Market is costly and mainly comprises rural products in higher rates. Many local peoples prefer nearby places like Ambikapur and Manendragarh for shopping. There are only few good shops here. There is a Supermarket located near the Premabagh area. Despite called a District, it lacks many services that must be present in the district level. Electricity is a big problem here. There is a constant cut in Electricity supply around the town without any appropriate reason.</p>
